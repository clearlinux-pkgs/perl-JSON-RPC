libjson-rpc-perl (1.03-1) experimental; urgency=low

  (New) Upstream says:

  JSON::RPC has been re-written and re-worked. It's a completely different
  code base now, and because the old code pre dates PSGI/Plack, we figured it
  was not worth making things API compatible. So if you have code that uses
  this old code and upgrade, YOUR CODE WILL BREAK!
